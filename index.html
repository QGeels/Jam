        <p>The hogweed is a plant known for its large, umbrella-like flowers and rugged appearance. There are two main types: common hogweed and giant hogweed.

            Giant hogweed is infamous for its sap, which can cause severe burns when in contact with the skin. Common hogweed is less dangerous but also has attractive flowers.

            Despite the potential risks, some people grow hogweeds in ornamental gardens due to their striking appearance. These plants thrive in various environments and are found throughout Europe. While they are impressive, caution should be exercised when handling hogweeds to minimize potential risks.</p>
